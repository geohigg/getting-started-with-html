    <b>
      Components of the web
    </b>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <u>Browser</u> - A Program <em> (example: Mozilla FireFox, Google Chrome, and Inernet Exploiter) </em> that is located on your computer <br>
       that is used to display files found on the web.
       <!-- I know it's called Internet Explorer, I'm making sure you are paying attention.  Also, this is a comment :) -->
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>
       <u>The Internet</u>- The worlds largest computer network.
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>
       <u>HTTP</u> - Also known as <u>H</u>yper <u>T</u>ext <u>T</u>ransfer <u>P</u>rotocol.  It is one of the main protocols of the web.
     </li>
     <br>
     <li>
       <u>Servers</u> - host the files that make up the web. 
     </li>
   </ul>
   <Strong>Examples of the files that make up the Web:</Strong>
   <ul>
     <li> Plain Text</li>
     <li> HTML</li>
     <li> Images</li>
     <li> Video</li>
     <li> Music</li>
     <br>
   </ul>
   <strong>HTML Basics:</strong>
   <br>
   <br>
   HTML, <em>Hyper Text Markup Language </em> is comprised of:
     <ul>
       <li>Text content - ie what you see.</li>
       <br><li>Markup - the construction blocks of html that define what the text looks like.</li>
       <br><li>References to other documents (Links to video, and images).</li>
       <br><li>Links to <a href = "http://www.udacity.com" title= "Udacity homepage!">other pages</a>.</li>
     </ul>
   <strong> Overview of HTML Markup:</strong>
   <p>HTML is comprised of tags which defines the behavior and appearance of a webpage.  Tags are structured as follows: <br>
    &ltname&gt content &lt/name&gt. <br>
    <li>&ltname&gt - is called the opening tag.</li>
    <li>contents - is called the tag contents.</li>
    <li>&lt/name&gt - is called the closing tag.</li>
    <br>
    The set of tags is also referred too as an <em>Element.</em> It is important to remember that the behavior of a tag will <br>
    remain in effect until it is closed &lt/&gt!
   </p>
   <u>Example elements found in this exercise</u>
     <ul>
       <li>&ltb&gt<b>Will make text bold</b> &lt/b&gt</li>
       <br><li>&ltem&gt<em>Will make text italic</em> &lt/em&gt</li>
        <br><li>&lta&gt</em> &lt/a&gt is an anchor tag.  An example of this tag in use is in the creation of a link to another webpage. <br>
        That tag is constructed with the following syntax:  &lta href = "url"&gt URL Plain text &lt/a&gt. In use it would look<br>
        something like this: <a href = "https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/100982870918349023509?cfem=1" title= "Udacity Introduction to Programming community homepage!">G+ Community Homepage!</a>
        </li></br>
        <li>&ltimg src = "URL" alt = "alternate text"&gt Will embed an image here.</li>
        <b>Note:</b> A closing tag is not needed for this element.  It is whats referred to as a Void Tag.
     </ul>
  <strong> Notes on Whitespace</strong> <br>
  <br>
  There are two types of whitespace
  <ol>
    <li> Inline</li>
    <li> Block</li>
  </ol>
  <u> Inline Whitespace:</u> Ends a line by wrapping text to a new line. <br>
  <br>
  <em> 
    Examples of inline elements are: 
  </em>
  <ul>
    <li> a</li>
    <li> span</li>
    <li> br</li>
    <li> img</li>
    <li> strong</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <u> Block Whitespace:</u> Adds an invisible box around the text encapsulated by the tag <br>
  <br>
  <em> 
    Examples of inline elements are: 
  </em>
  <ul>
    <li> p</li>
    <li> div</li>
    <li> form</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>
    The Structure of an HTML Document:
  </strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  The bare bones markup of an html document looks like this... <br>
  <p>
    &lt!DOCTYPE HTML&gt <br>
    &lthtml&gt <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lttitle&gt TITLE &lt/title&gt<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltcontent&gt the content (text, images, links, etc) is contained in the HTML body &lt/content&gt<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<br>
    &lt/html&gt <br>
  </p>
